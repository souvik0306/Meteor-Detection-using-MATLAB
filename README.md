# Meteor-Detection-using-MATLAB
Meteor Detection via MATLAB using Image Processing Toolbox and Hough Transformation
## Aim of the Project
In this project I've tried to detect meteor using various night sky images depicting a possible meteor by applying the principles of Hough Transform and various available system functions.
The Image Processing Toolbox supports functions that enable you to use the Hough transform to detect lines in an image.

The Hough Function available in MATLAB(hough) implements the Standard Hough Transform (SHT). The Hough transform is designed to detect lines, using the parametric representation of a line:
rho = x*cos(theta) + y*sin(theta)
