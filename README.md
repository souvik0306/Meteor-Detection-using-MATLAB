# Meteor-Detection-using-MATLAB
Meteor Detection via MATLAB using Image Processing Toolbox and Hough Transformation.
The Image Processing Toolboxâ„¢ supports functions that enable you to use the Hough transform to detect lines in an image.
The hough function implements the Standard Hough Transform (SHT). The Hough transform is designed to detect lines, using the parametric representation of a line:
rho = x*cos(theta) + y*sin(theta)
